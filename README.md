## Case Scenario: Shubham's New iPhone Purchase

Shubham's current phone is showing its age. Slow performance, a cracked screen, and a dwindling battery have made it clear: it's time for an upgrade. He's been eyeing the new Apple iPhone 15 and decides to purchase it from an online e-commerce website he's used before.

He logs into his account, confident that his saved address and payment information will make the process quick and easy. He searches for the iPhone 15, adds it to his cart, and takes a moment to browse related accessories, like cases and screen protectors. He then proceeds to checkout, selects his preferred delivery address, chooses his saved payment method, and confirms the order.

Shubham is excited to receive his new phone and looks forward to tracking its delivery. He also appreciates the email confirmation he receives, providing him with peace of mind. He knows that if he has any issues, he can easily check his order status on the website.
